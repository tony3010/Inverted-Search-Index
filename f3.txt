The C programming language is powerful and efficient. It provides low level memory access using pointers. Functions allow modular programming and code reuse. Structures help organize related data. File handling enables reading and writing data to files. Dynamic memory allocation uses malloc and free. Debugging tools like gdb help find errors. Compilers translate source code into machine code. The Linux operating system is commonly used for C development. Mastering C programming builds a strong foundation for embedded systems, operating systems, and performance critical applications.
